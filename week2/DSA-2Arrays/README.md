Arrays are one of the most fundamental data structures.
They store multiple elements in a contiguous memory location and allow fast access using indexes.

In Python, we usually use lists to represent arrays.

🔹 Why Arrays?

Understanding arrays is important because:

They are the building blocks for advanced data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues).

Arrays allow efficient searching and sorting.

They strengthen problem-solving skills that are useful in AI pipelines when handling datasets.

By practicing array problems, I learned how to:
✔️ Access and manipulate data using indices.
✔️ Check conditions efficiently.
✔️ Rearrange elements with optimized logic.
✔️ Use arrays for data generation and filtering (like odd/even numbers).

🔹 Key Learnings

Arrays taught me how to think step by step while solving problems.

I learned about time complexity O(n) in traversal-based problems.

Practicing arrays improved my understanding of conditions, loops, and filtering logic.

These exercises built confidence for tackling more complex data structures like linked lists, stacks, and queues.
