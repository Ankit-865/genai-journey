✅ [Day 8 – Learned file-based reporting, added category report to Expense Tracker.]
✅ [Day 9 – Started learning OOP, began class-based Expense Tracker.]
✅ [Day 10 – Learned OOP methods, integrated file handling into Expense Tracker.]
✅ [Day 11 – Learned OOP inheritance, added ReportManager for category reporting.]
✅ [Day 12 – Revised all topics, built Personal Finance Dashboard to reinforce learning.]
✅ [Day 13 – Added Inventory Management System]

📚 Week 2 - 3 – Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA in Python)

🔹 Goal → Strengthen problem-solving fundamentals needed for scalable AI pipelines.
Not going extremely deep like competitive programming, but enough to understand efficiency, memory flow, and scalability.

✅ Practiced Big O Notation (time & space complexity basics)
✅ Implemented Binary Search (O(log n))
✅ Completed Arrays:

Find Largest Element

Check if Array is Sorted

Move All Zeros to End

Generate Odd Numbers up to N

✅ Completed Linked List:

Singly Linked List (insert, remove, search, insert after value)

Doubly Linked List (forward/backward traversal, insertion, deletion)

✅ Completed HashMap & File Handling:

Weather Data Analysis using arrays

Fast Weather Lookup with dictionary

Word Frequency Counter (poem.txt)

Custom Hash Table implementation with Linear Probing

✅ Completed Stack:

Reversed a string using Stack (LIFO)

Checked for Balanced Parentheses (), {}, [] using Stack

✅ Completed Queue:

Designed a Food Ordering System using Multithreading & Queue (Producer-Consumer Problem)

Generated Binary Numbers (1 to N) using Queue (BFS-style sequence generation)

✅ Completed Trees & Binary Trees:

Built a General Tree with Name/Designation printing (Org chart style)

Implemented Binary Search Tree with Insert, Search, Min, Max, Traversals, Sum

Implemented BST Deletion using Max from Left Subtree (Preserved BST properties)

✅ Completed Graphs:

Represented Graphs using Adjacency List

Found All Paths between two nodes (DFS approach)

Found the Shortest Path between two nodes

🧮 Week4 – NumPy Project: Data Cleaning & Sorting

🎯 Goal: Learn and apply NumPy concepts through a real-world data cleaning project.

🧠 Concepts Learned

NumPy array properties, indexing, and slicing

Data loading using np.genfromtxt()

Handling encoding and malformed rows

Filtering and masking invalid numeric data

Sorting arrays by column (SALES descending)

Exporting clean data with np.savetxt()

🧩 Project Workflow

Downloaded Kaggle dataset: Sample Sales Data

Created professional folder structure:

numpy project/
├── data/
├── scripts/
└── output/


Loaded dataset and handled missing/invalid entries

Cleaned and filtered valid sales/quantity data

Sorted results by sales value

Saved cleaned and sorted data to output/cleaned_sales.csv

🧾 Skills Demonstrated

Data preprocessing using NumPy

Problem-solving with messy datasets

File handling, encoding management, and data transformation

Organizing Python projects cleanly

🧾 Dataset Source: Sample Sales Data – Kaggle

📅 Week 5 – Pandas & Data Analysis

🎯 Goal → Learn data analysis and cleaning using the Pandas library.

📘 Upcoming Focus

Understanding Series and DataFrame structures

Reading and writing data using Pandas (read_csv, to_csv)

Handling missing values (fillna, dropna)

Sorting, filtering, and grouping data

Applying aggregate functions (sum, mean, count)

Merging and joining multiple datasets

Integrating Pandas with NumPy for hybrid workflows

📂 Code → Week 5 – Pandas Folder (will include daily notebooks and mini-projects)
