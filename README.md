📚 Week 2 – Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA in Python)

🔹 Goal → Strengthen problem-solving fundamentals needed for scalable AI pipelines.
Not going extremely deep like competitive programming, but enough to understand efficiency, memory flow, and scalability.

✅ Practiced Big O Notation (time & space complexity basics)
✅ Implemented Binary Search (O(log n))
🔜 Upcoming in Week 2:

Arrays, Linked List, Hash Table, Stack, Queue

Trees & Graphs

Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort

Recursion
