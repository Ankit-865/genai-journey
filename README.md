🧮 NumPy – Data Cleaning & Sorting Project

🎯 Goal → Learn numerical data processing using NumPy through a real-world dataset.

🧠 Concepts Learned

NumPy array properties, indexing & slicing

Data loading with np.genfromtxt()

Handling encoding & malformed rows

Filtering & masking invalid values

Sorting by column (Sales – descending)

Exporting cleaned data using np.savetxt()

🧩 Project Workflow

🧠 Key Learnings

Pandas is the backbone of real-world data pipelines

Clean data > complex models

Script-based workflows resemble production systems

GenAI engineers spend significant time in preprocessing

📈 Matplotlib – Data Visualization & EDA

🎯 Goal → Learn how to visualize data and extract insights using Matplotlib, a core EDA skill.

🧠 What I Worked On

✔ Visualized sales data using Matplotlib
✔ Script-based plotting (not notebook-only)
✔ Integrated Pandas + Matplotlib workflow

🧩 Visualizations Implemented

Sales Distribution (Histogram)

Category-wise Revenue (Bar Chart)

Monthly Sales Trend (Line Plot)

🛠 Key Concepts

Matplotlib architecture

Figure sizing, labels & layouts

File path & encoding handling

GroupBy + visualization (industry-standard EDA)

📊 Seaborn – Statistical Data Visualization & EDA (NEW)

🎯 Goal → Perform statistical, data-aware visualization for deeper Exploratory Data Analysis.

🧠 Learning Approach

First practiced all Seaborn functions using built-in datasets (e.g. penguins)

Focused on understanding why a plot is used

Then applied the same concepts to a real-world sales dataset

📚 Seaborn Functions Covered

histplot, kdeplot – Distribution analysis

countplot, barplot – Categorical & aggregated comparison

lineplot – Trend analysis

scatterplot + hue, style, size – Multi-dimensional relationships
