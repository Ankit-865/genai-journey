# ðŸ§± Stack Data Structure â€“ Practice Problems  

In this section of my **DSA Journey (Week 2)**, I focused on **stacks**, one of the most important linear data structures.  
Stacks follow **LIFO (Last In First Out)** order and are widely used in parsing, recursion, undo/redo operations, and memory management.

## âœ… Problems I Solved  

### 1. Reverse a String using Stack
**Goal:** Write a function that reverses a string using stack operations.  

```python
reverse_string("We will conquer COVID-19")
# Output: "91-DIVOC reuqnoc lliw eW"
Learning:
This exercise helped me understand how push() and pop() naturally reverse order of elements when retrieved from a stack.

2. Balanced Parentheses Checker
Goal: Verify whether all types of parentheses (), {}, [] are properly balanced.

python
Copy code
is_balanced("({a+b})")       # True  
is_balanced("))((a+b}{")     # False  
is_balanced("[a+b]*(x+2y)")  # True  
Learning:
This is a classic use case of stacks â€“ every time we see an opening bracket, we push it, and every time we see a closing bracket, we pop and match it.
This gave me an intuition for expression validation and how compilers parse code internally.

ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways
Stack is the perfect data structure when order reversal or matching (LIFO) is required.

Practical applications:

Expression evaluation

Undo/Redo functionality

Browser back/forward history

Recursion call stack
